              <h3>Giraffes</h3>
  <p>Giraffes are large, long-necked mammals native to Africa.They are the tallest land animals on Earth,
    with adult males reaching heights of up to 18 feet (5.5 meters). Giraffes belong to the species Giraffa
    camelopardalis and are known for their distinctive spotted coats, long legs, and prehensile tongues,
     which they use to feed on leavesâ€”especially from acacia trees. Their long necks help them
      reach high vegetation and also play a role in  social behavior like "necking," a form of combat among males.
