              <h3>LION</h3>
  <p> The lion (Panthera leo) is one of the five big cats in the genus Panthera and a member of the family Felidae.
   The commonly used term African lion collectively denotes the   the several subspecies found in Africa.
    With some males exceeding 250 kg (550 lb) in weight,it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger.
    Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in Asia (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir
     Forest National Park in India) while other types of lions have disappeared from North Africa and Southwest
     Asia in historic times.Until the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago,the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans.
