              <h3>Gorillas</h3>
  <p>Gorillas are ground-dwelling, predominantly herbivorous apes that inhabit the forests of central Africa.
    The eponymous genus Gorilla is divided into two species:the eastern gorillas and the western gorillas,
     and either four or five subspecies. They are the largest living primates by physical size. The DNA
      of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans,from 95 to 99% depending on what is counted,
      and they are the next closest living relatives to humans after the chimpanzees and bonobos.
      Gorillas' natural habitats cover tropical or subtropical forests in Africa.Although their range
      covers a small percentage of Africa, gorillas cover a wide range of elevations.
